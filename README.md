Game is working! based on the classic frogger arcade game 1981 that was an instant success!

Basic Functionality

You are the player, and the enemies bugs are keeping you from moving to the water for safety!

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the Enemies (Bugs). 
The player can move left, right, up and down using the arrows on the keyboard.
The Enemies (Bugs) move in varying speeds across the concrete block portion of the rock scene. 

When you the player collides with the bug, then the player is reset back to his/her initial position on the board.
You win the game when the player successfully reaches the water safely.

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
